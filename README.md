# Bounties

## Community IFO Auction

Prize: $12,500

Develop a system similar to PancakeSwap [Farm Auction](https://pancakeswap.finance/farms/auction) where users and project owners can propose fresh new tokens to be launched on PancakeSwap IFO platform.

Requirements:

- No-loss mechanics for users who vote/bid for the projects. Possible solution is to redistribute CAKE into winnerâ€™s IFO with some bonus incentive for bidders.
- System must strive to have minimal amount of manual work regarding preparation of the IFO Auction and further IFO launch.

Judging criteria:

- Solid smart contract with good clear code
- Good documentation
- Proof of concept front-end
  - Minimal React app or at least Figma mockups to understand general flow
  - Integration to our [frontend](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-frontend) is a huge plus, but not necessary

## NFT Marketplace Improvements

Prize: $20,000

Improve existing PancakeSwap NFT Marketplace with some of the following features (not necessary to implement everything, but the more the better):

- Support for ERC1155 tokens
- Auto-indexing NFT collections
  - Currently PancakeSwap only lists fully-minted NFT collections. In order to support not fully minted collections we need a robust way to index new mints.
- Offer price
  - Allow users to offer the NFT sellers different price for listed NFT
  - Allow users to offer to buy NFTs currently not listed for sale
- CAKE as payment method
  - Allow users to buy / sell NFTs not only with BNB but with CAKE

Judging criteria:

- Solid smart contract with good clear code
- Good documentation
- Integration with our front-end is a huge plus
